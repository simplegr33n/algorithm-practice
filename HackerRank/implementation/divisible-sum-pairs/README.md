https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/divisible-sum-pairs

You are given an array of `n` integers, `a0, a1, ..., a(n-1)` , and a positive integer, `k`. Find and print the number of `(i,j)` pairs where `i < j` and `a(i)` + `a(j)` is evenly divisible by `k`.

### Input Format

The first line contains `2` space-separated integers, `n` and `k`, respectively. 
The second line contains `n` space-separated integers describing the respective values of `a0, a1, ..., a(n-1)`.

### Constraints

`2 <= n <= 100`

`1 <= k <= 100`

`1 <= a(i) <= 100`

### Output Format

Print the number of `(i,j)` pairs where `i < j` and `a(i)` + `a(j)` is evenly divisible by `k`.

### Sample Input
```
6 3
1 3 2 6 1 2
```
### Sample Output
```
 5
